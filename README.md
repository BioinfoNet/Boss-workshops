# Boss-workshops

_Welcome to BOSS Workshops which is part of the series of events in the **"Empowering Researchers with Skills and Tools in Open Science and Bioinformatics"**. This is a two-week training workshop that introduces the trainees to basic and advanced Linux scripting. In week 2 they will tackle real biological questions using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, whilst applying the gained skills from the first week._
